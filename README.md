### Hi there 👋

# Emmanuel-Afolabi
**About Me**
A Computer Science Student at Kibo School of Technology
I'm a frontend developer and a professional chess instructor. I am passionate about becoming a software engineer soon and solving real-life problems.
I am a fan of working in a team/collaborating with others as it makes me even better and learn more.
I love to teach and share my knowledge with others that's why the other part of me is a chess instructor. Anytime I'm outside my laptop and not coding, I'm either teaching chess to my clients or playing chess.

**Skills**
I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL and Bootstrap.
I am a good team player also with good communication skills.
I have good problem solving/analytical skills through the knowledge I gained from chess.
