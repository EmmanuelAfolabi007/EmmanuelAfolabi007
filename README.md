### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emmanuel, a Computer Science Student at Kibo School of Technology aspiring to be a software engineer. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python alongisde frameworks like Flask and Express.
I am currently a frontend developer and a professional chess instructor. I am passionate about becoming a software engineer so as to create solutions to real-life problems. I am excited to engage in more project this year.
I am a fan of working in a team/collaborating with others as it makes me even better and learn more.
I love to teach and share my knowledge with others that's why the other part of me is a chess instructor. Anytime I'm outside my laptop and not coding, I'm either teaching or playing chess.
I am a good team player with great communication and analytical skills.
